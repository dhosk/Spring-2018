    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we will need to assemble two main datasets.\n",
    "This notebook will show process for doing this and conclude with saving two .pkl files to be used in the analysis notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset 1. NBA game stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset will contain player stats from 2014-2018, all retrieved from stats.nba using their API. These stats will be used to cluster players into a more modern view of positions, which we will attempt to predict using the next dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categories of stats included:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard advanced -\n",
    "Things like AST%, AST/TO ratio, OREB%, TS%. These are usually linear combinations of standard box score stats(AST,REB,FG,FGA,etc.) but also include these stats in comparison with their teams as a whole in the example of AST% or OREB%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per 100 Possesion - \n",
    "Regular box score statistics weighted per 100 possesion. 100 possesion chosen over per game or totals as a players volume should not affect how they are classified positionally. Per 36 minutes also may have been chosen but those are all affected by a teams pace. Perhaps different player types play in a faster pace system but if we wanted to focus on something like team style for player analysis we would incororate those team stats directly. This might be an avenue to pursue in the future but regardless per 100 possesion stats make the most sense for the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Defensive Player Tracking - \n",
    "hese are derived through NBA player tracking data. They tell how many shots a player defended (or more accurately, was the closest defender for) and their success rate on such. They are segmented by distance away from the basket and also give some measure of the expected FG% of these shots. Likely simply a weighted average of the FG% for those who took each shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring - This breaks down field goals makes,attempt by percent from location, and whether or not assisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other considersations/future inclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "BBall Reference advanced - Basketball reference has several other advanced stats such as BPM, Win Share and Vorp. These are generally linear combinations of already included statistics but might be useful nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "More tracking data - While no raw tracking data is available. the stats.nba API is very fast with data derived from it. This could be used to include more defense related data. This route also features playtype data. For example how many drives or isolation plays did a player have for game. It also includes information on dribbling, touch time, and closest defender. A lot of these might be helpful and I intend to examine their relation for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team stats - This was mentioned lightly above. Teams that play in high pace, high 3 point shooting, agressive blitzing, traditional, or a variety of other systems might have a focus on certain players. Using data that suggests things like that might be helpful in determing where a player lands. It makes more sense to me however, to classify players and then determine a teams playtyle off that. Or using a teams playstyle see what types of players perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset 2. Combine/College stats\n",
    "\n",
    "These stats will be used to predict what position a draft prospect is most likely to play. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categories of stats included:\n",
    "Draft measurements and drill results - These too are pulled from the stats.nba api. They include anthroporthic data including wingspan, hand length, height. Drill results include vertical leap, three quarter sprint, and lane agility time. \n",
    "\n",
    "College statitics - These are scraped from basketball reference (violation of terms and service please don't tell anyone). Advanced statistics like those mentioned above (including the bball reference specific win share, vorp, etc.) Also per 40 minutes regular box score stats were included. I initially wanted to use per 100 possesion stats, but those only dated back to 2011. A revisit to this project might decide to use those and limit players available to see if that improves prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Impution:\n",
    "A decent amount of players either completely missed the draft or did not participate in certain drills. For player who missed the draft, their height, weight, and position were pulled from stats.nba via other access points. Using height weight and position a simple linear model was built to impute the results for other players. This seemed to make sense a 7 foot tall player will have a longer wingspan, or a 190 pound guard should be quicker in a three quarter sprint than a 280 pound big man. \n",
    "A total of blank/blank players had their stats completely determiend this way\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other considerations/future inclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some player have combine data available from individual combines. If a comprehensive dataset of this is available this might help complete the data without need for impution. Other than this certain unique players may be chosen and looked up but this would get tedious for only 5-10 rows of data becoming more complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using college stats means there is no inclusion of euroleague players. Euroleague stats are not a perfect comparision to college stats or even each other (though neither are college stats one could argue). I have not yet figured out how I would go about incorporating these into the same dataset. Perhaps I could build seperate models if there is suffient data. For now I choose to exclude players coming from europe. "

    "A start year of 2008 was chosen rather arbitrarily. I wanted a suffiently large data set (also arbitrary). I wanted to choose only more recent player as certain features were only recored after certain years. Also since this is a focus on modern NBA positions and it might be hard to predict where a player coming out of college in 2007 will be playing in 2017 when their style of play, and more importantly the leagues will have changed significantly by then.
